This sample demonstrates the combination of a few frameworks. The sample is easy to start but you do have to make Vert.x
available on your path. If you have vert.x running, there are a few things to do:

1. Install vert.x: http://vertx.io/install.html
2. Install mongodb: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads
3. cd into the main folder of the sample (where this readme.txt file is)
4. start the sample: vertx run app/App.groovy
5. point your browser to: http://localhost:8080

That should be it
